Here's how you can partner Microsoft Reactor and get started to landing a Let's Get Technical series in your market. 
<br/>
## Background
The Letâ€™s Get Technical is a series of three short 55-minute virtual events, delivering technical demos and know-hows on the latest technologies in Asia. Debuting in Indonesia, then the Philippines and recently in Thailand, this series focuses on the regional markets in Asia, and is now making its way to Singapore, Vietnam and the Greater China. 

Each event in the Let's Get Technical series is carefully curated and will feature a well-diversed group of guest speakers who are experts in their respective fields. They will share their insights, experiences, and thought-provoking ideas during interactive sessions.
<br/>
## Objectives 
The 60 minute-event series is aimed to amplify the voices of our Community Leaders and Subject Matter Experts, and to engage developers from the local markets, help them to achieve success, and at the same time, grow awareness of our Reactor programs. 
<br/>

ðŸ‘‰ We are inviting you to partner with us to bring this series to your market, so that your voices of your local communities can be heard and the latest technologies can be brought to your market.
